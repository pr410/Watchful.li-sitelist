Watchful.li sitelist
====================

With this script you can display an overview of all your Watchful.li sites and export the data to Excel.
For easy browsing and searching in the site list the jQuery DataTables plugin was added.

To get this working you need a Watchful.li API key that you can get through your Watchful.li profile.
Install the API key on line 10 of sitelist.php.
